msaenet implements the multi-step adaptive elastic-net (MSAENet)
algorithm for feature selection in high-dimensional regressions proposed
in Xiao and Xu (2015) \[[PDF](https://nanx.me/papers/msaenet.pdf)\].

Nonconvex multi-step adaptive estimations based on MCP-net or SCAD-net
are also supported.

Check `vignette("msaenet")` to get started.

## Installation

You can install msaenet from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("msaenet")
```

Or try the development version on GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("nanxstats/msaenet")
```
