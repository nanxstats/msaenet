`msaenet` implements the multi-step adaptive elastic-net (MSAENet)
algorithm for feature selection in high-dimensional regressions proposed
in Xiao and Xu (2015)
\<[DOI:10.1080/00949655.2015.1016944](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00949655.2015.1016944)\>
([PDF](https://nanx.me/papers/msaenet.pdf)).

Nonconvex multi-step adaptive estimations based on MCP-net or SCAD-net
are also supported.

Check `vignette("msaenet")` for a quick-start.

## Installation

You can install `msaenet` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("msaenet")
```

Or try the development version on GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("nanxstats/msaenet")
```
