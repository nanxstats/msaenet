Description: Multi-step adaptive elastic-net (MSAENet) algorithm for
    feature selection in high-dimensional regressions proposed in
    Xiao and Xu (2015) <DOI:10.1080/00949655.2015.1016944>,
    with support for multi-step adaptive MCP-net (MSAMNet) and
    multi-step adaptive SCAD-net (MSASNet) methods.
