# msaenet 2.9 (2018-05-13)

## Improvements

- New URL for the documentation website: https://nanx.me/msaenet/.

# msaenet 2.8 (2018-01-05)

## New Features

- Added a Cleveland dot plot option `type = "dotplot"` in `plot.msaenet()`. This plot offers a direct visualization of the model coefficients at the optimal step.

# msaenet 2.7 (2017-09-24)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the missing arguments issue when `init = "ridge"`.

# msaenet 2.6 (2017-04-23)

## Improvements

- Added two arguments `lower.limits` and `upper.limits` to support coefficient constraints in `aenet()` and `msaenet()` [[#1](https://github.com/road2stat/msaenet/issues/1)].

# msaenet 2.5 (2017-03-24)

## Improvements

- Better code indentation style.
- Update gallery images in `README.md`.

# msaenet 2.4 (2017-02-17)

## Improvements

- Improved graphical details for coefficient path plots, following the general graphic style in the ESL (*The Elements of Statistical Learning*) book.
- More options available in `plot.msaenet()` for extra flexibility: it is now possible to set important properties of the label appearance such as position, offset, font size, and axis titles via the new arguments `label.pos`, `label.offset`, `label.cex`, `xlab`, and `ylab`.

# msaenet 2.3 (2017-02-09)

## Improvements

- Reduced model saturation cases and improved speed at the initialization step for MCP-net and SCAD-net based models when `init = "ridge"`, by using the ridge estimation implementation from `glmnet`. As a benefit, we now have a more aligned baseline for the comparison between elastic-net based models and MCP-net/SCAD-net based models when `init = "ridge"`.
- Style improvements in code and examples: reduced whitespace with a new formatting scheme.

# msaenet 2.2 (2017-02-02)

## New Features

- Added BIC, EBIC, and AIC in addition to k-fold cross-validation for model selection.
- Added new arguments `tune` and `tune.nsteps` to controls this for selecting the optimal model for each step, and the optimal model among all steps (i.e. the optimal step).
- Added arguments `ebic.gamma` and `ebic.gamma.nsteps` to control the EBIC tuning parameter, if `ebic` is specified by `tune` or `tune.nsteps`.
- Redesigned plot function: now supports two types of plots (coefficient path, screeplot of the optimal step selection criterion), optimal step highlighting, variable labeling, and color palette customization. See `?plot.msaenet` for details.

## Improvements

- Renamed previous argument `gamma` (scaling factor for adaptive weights) to `scale` to avoid possible confusion.
- Reset the default values of candidate concavity parameter `gammas` to be 3.7 for SCAD-net and 3 for MCP-net.
- Unified the supported model `family` in all model types to be `"gaussian"`, `"binomial"`, `"poisson"`, and `"cox"`.

# msaenet 2.1 (2017-01-15)

## New Features

- Added functions `msaenet.sim.binomial()`, `msaenet.sim.poisson()`, `msaenet.sim.cox()` to generate simulation data for logistic, Poisson, and Cox regression models.
- Added function `msaenet.fn()` for computing the number of false negative selections in msaenet models.
- Added function `msaenet.mse()` for computing mean squared error (MSE).

## Improvements

- Speed improvements in `msaenet.sim.gaussian()` by more vectorization when generating correlation matrices.
- Added parameters `max.iter` and `epsilon` for MCP-net and SCAD-net related functions to have finer control over convergence criterion. By default, `max.iter = 10000` and `epsilon = 1e-4`.

# msaenet 2.0 (2017-01-05)

## New Features

- Added support for adaptive MCP-net. See `?amnet` for details.
- Added support for adaptive SCAD-net. See `?asnet` for details.
- Added support for multi-step adaptive MCP-net (MSAMNet). See `?msamnet` for details.
- Added support for multi-step adaptive SCAD-net (MSASNet). See `?msasnet` for details.
- Added `msaenet.nzv.all()` for displaying the indices of non-zero variables in all adaptive estimation steps.

## Improvements

- More flexible `predict.msaenet` method allowing users to specify prediction type.

# msaenet 1.1 (2016-12-28)

## New Features

- Added method `coef` for extracting model coefficients.
  See `?coef.msaenet` for details.

## Improvements

- New documentation website generated by pkgdown,
  with a full set of function documentation and vignettes available.
- Added Windows continuous integration support using AppVeyor.

# msaenet 1.0 (2016-09-20)

## New Features

- Initial version of the msaenet package
